# RFM Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains SQL queries used to perform **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** analysis on customer data. The project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, helping businesses identify key customer groups and implement targeted marketing strategies. The SQL queries and analysis provide valuable insights into customer loyalty, buying habits, and revenue opportunities.

The RFM model is a proven technique for categorizing customers to optimize marketing efforts, improve retention, and enhance overall business performance.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following components:

- **SQL Queries**: A collection of SQL queries for RFM segmentation, customer analysis, and performance reporting.
- **Sample Data (Optional)**: A sample dataset that can be used to test the queries.
- **Reports (Optional)**: A detailed report summarizing the findings of the analysis and the recommended strategies for customer engagement.
- **README.md**: A comprehensive guide explaining the project, usage, and methodology.

## SQL Queries

### 1. **rfm_segmentation.sql**
   This query segments customers based on three primary metrics:
   - **Recency**: The time since the customer's last purchase.
   - **Frequency**: How often the customer makes a purchase.
   - **Monetary**: The total amount spent by the customer.
   
   It categorizes customers into different groups based on these metrics, providing a foundation for further analysis.

### 2. **high_value_customers.sql**
   Identifies **High-Value Loyal Customers** who have made frequent purchases recently and spent above a certain threshold. These customers represent the core of the business and should be targeted with loyalty programs or special offers.

### 3. **low_value_customers.sql**
   Finds **Low-Value Infrequent Shoppers** who make occasional purchases and have a lower spend. These customers represent an opportunity for re-engagement through targeted promotions or incentives.

### 4. **rfm_analysis_summary.sql**
   Provides a comprehensive summary of the RFM analysis, ranking customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary values. This query helps to identify which customers need more attention and which ones are prime candidates for retention efforts.
